# Reinforcement-Learning-for-Adaptive-Traffic-Light-Control
This undergraduate project focuses on the development and application of a reinforcement learning algorithm to manage a simulated single-intersection traffic control system. The primary goal is to create an adaptive traffic light control system that responds in real-time to varying traffic conditions, effectively reducing congestion and improving overall traffic flow. The reinforcement learning algorithm will be trained to optimize traffic light timings based on the observed traffic conditions. The student will employ simulated environments to train and evaluate the model, using metrics like average waiting time and traffic throughput for performance assessment. This project is an exciting opportunity to apply reinforcement learning techniques to a real-world problem, giving the student valuable hands-on experience in machine learning, simulation design, and algorithm development.
